Howdy,

This was a good kata. I didnt quite get to the finish.

TODO:

Implement inspectors for Straight, ThreeOfAKind, TwoPair, OnePair

Implement an end to end test to create a hand and then identify what it is

Implement ranking to be able to rank 2 hands

Sort out the nodejs build, not doing what I wanted it to do (experimental)

Im pretty happy with where it ended up.
