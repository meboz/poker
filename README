Howdy,

This was a good kata. I didnt quite get to the finish.

TODO:

DONE: Implement inspectors for Straight, ThreeOfAKind, TwoPair, OnePair

DONE: Implement an end to end test to create a hand and then identify what it is

Implement ranking to be able to rank 2 hands against each other

Sort out the nodejs build, not doing what I wanted it to do (experimental)

See tag FourHourMark for the result i got to in the four hours.

Im much happier with the end result this morning.
